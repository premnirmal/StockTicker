## App features

- A home screen widget that shows your stock portfolio in a resizable grid.
- Stocks can be sorted by dragging and dropping the list.
- Only performs automatic fetching of stocks during trading hours.

### Description

- Search Stock you want to add (BlackBerry is `BB` in NYSE and `RI1` in XFRA, for example, EUR and USD will be shown accordingly)
- Add the stocks you have to calculate the average. If various amounts of positions were bought at different times, add each buy individually so everything can be calculated correcly.

### Importing and exporting
- You can import a list of tickers by selecting **import tickers** from the settings menu. All you need is a textfile with your tickers in *comma-separated* format, or in *json format*.
- You can also export your tickers to a *json* file by selecting **export tickers**.
